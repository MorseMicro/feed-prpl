        Include wireless STA support.
        For intel_mips platforms, leave this option enabled  to have wireless station support.
        For other platforms, the wireless station support is included by default and cannot be disabled.

        Set the root datamodel to be used, by default will be set to Device.WiFi.DataElements, unless if any project changes 
        it to something else.
        This may be helpful when several third-party packages have something in Device.WiFi.
