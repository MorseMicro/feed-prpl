Subject: [PATCH] src: makefile: fix missing libsahtrace search path
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently build fails during linking step:

 cannot find -lsahtrace

That's happening due to the fact, that libsahtrace is being installed to
STAGINGDIR/lib, but that path is missing in the linker paths. So fix it
by adding STAGING_LIBDIR into the linker args.
